/*
1. write a program that ill ask user to enter two numbers and calculates the sum of those two numbers. then
                    it asks the user if he/she wants to continue
                    if the answer is yes, repeat the whole process again
                    if the answer is no, only return the addition
                    but while the answer is neither yes or no, the the program should repeatedly
                    ask the user re-enter
            HINT: nested loop task, outter loop need to be an infinite loop
