Interface by DEFAULT (implicitly done):
    100% abstraction
    Access modifier: public only
    Specifier : STATIC, FINAL
    methods: by default is abstract

    Variables: static
    Methods: static
             abstract
             default (probably not will be asked)

 We cannot have:
    Constructor - interface is not a class
    instance methods - because there's no objects
    instance variables
    blocks  - var. by default static, final, public

Abstact and Interface class
    NEVER FINAL
